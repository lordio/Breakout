Breakout
========

A simple implementation of the classic game Breakout.

The Windows project files were created with Microsoft Visual Studio Express 2013.

To build properly, this repository must be cloned into the same directory as Insanity, and you must have already built that library. On platforms other than OSX, you must also build the Gel library.

How to play
-----------

The game will start paused. Press the "P" key to toggle pausing.
Use the keyboard arrow keys to move the paddle left and right.
Keep the ball from touching the bottom of the screen, or the game will immediately exit.

Your score is shown in the console window that will accompany the game window.

When you clear a level, the game will pause and reset, preserving your score.
